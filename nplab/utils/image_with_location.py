Image With Location
===================

This datatype supports the various operations that rely on linking a camera to a microscope stage.  It is an image
along with the metadata required to relate positions in the image to positions in real life.

A note on coordinate systems
----------------------------
I've tried to stick to two coordinate systems: that used by the stage, generally called a "location", and pixels in an
image.  Older code often refers to "points" which are in units of fractions-of-an-image; these are not used any more as
they got too confusing.

Images have a "datum pixel", specified in metadata or assumed to be the centre (i.e. pixel (N-1)/2 for a width of N).
This need not be an integer pixel position, but is specified in pixels relative to the [0,0] pixel.  When considering
something within an image, the coordinate system is always relative to pixel [0,0], not relative to the datum pixel.
Similarly, the transformation matrix that moves between pixel and stage coordinates uses [0,0] as its origin, not the
datum pixel.  However, when considering the displacement between two images, this is usually with respect to the datum
pixels of the images - though we should generally specify this.

We transform between pixel and location coordinate systems with a matrix, the `pixel_to_sample_matrix`.  Usually it
is called ``M`` in mathematical expressions.  To convert a pixel coordinate to a location, we post-multiply the pixel
coordinate by the matrix, i.e. ``l = p.M`` and to convert the other way we use the inverse of ``M`` so ``p = l.M``
where the dot denotes matrix multiplication using `numpy.dot`.
