# PyVCAM Wrapper

PyVCAM Wrapper is a Python3.X wrapper for the PVCAM SDK.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to get PyVCAM up and running on your machine for development and testing.


### Prerequisites
* An understanding of PVCAM is very helpful for understanding PyVCAM.
* A C/C++ compiler is needed to build native source code. For Windows, MSVC 1928 was used for testing.
* The newest version of Python 3 which can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* The latest PVCAM and PVCAM SDK which can be downloaded [here](https://www.photometrics.com/support/software/#software).
* PyVCAM was developed and tested using Microsoft Windows 10/64-bit. The build package also supports Linux, but testing has been minimal.


### Installing
When you are ready to install the wrapper use your command prompt to navigate into the directory that contains 
setup.py and run ```python setup.py install``` 


### How to use the wrapper
#### Create Camera Example
This will create a camera object using the first camera that is found that can then be used to interact with the camera.
```
from pyvcam import pvc 
from pyvcam.camera import Camera   

pvc.init_pvcam()                   # Initialize PVCAM 
cam = next(Camera.detect_camera()) # Use generator to find first camera. 
cam.open()                         # Open the camera.
```

#### Single Image Example
This captures a single image with a 20 ms exposure time and prints the values of the first 5 pixels.
```
# A camera object named cam has already been created
frame = cam.get_frame(exp_time=20)
print("First five pixels of frame: {}, {}, {}, {}, {}".format(*frame[:5]))
```

#### Changing Settings Example
This is an example of how to change some of the settings on the cameras.
```
# A camera object named cam has already been created
cam.clear_mode = "Never"
cam.exp_mode = "Ext Trig Trig First"
cam.readout_port = 0
cam.speed_table_index = 0
cam.gain = 1
```
