## src
Where the source code of the pyvcam module is located. In addition to the code for the module, any additional scripts that are used to help write the module are included as well. The most notable helper script that is not included in the module is constants_generator.py, which generates the constants.py module by parsing the pvcam header file. 

## pyvcam
The directory that contains the source code to the pyvcam module. These are the files installed when users install the module. 

### camera.py
The camera.py module contains the Camera python class which is used to abstract the need to manually maintain, alter, and remember camera settings through PVCAM. 

#### Create Camera Example
This will create a camera object using the first camera that is found that can then be used to interact with the camera

```
from pyvcam import pvc 
from pyvcam.camera import Camera   

pvc.init_pvcam()                   # Initialize PVCAM 
cam = next(Camera.detect_camera()) # Use generator to find first camera. 
cam.open()                         # Open the camera.
```

#### Attributes of Camera:
| Attribute     | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| __name | A private instance variable that contains the camera's name. Note that this should be a read only attribute, meaning it should never be changed or set. PVCAM will handle the generation of camera names and will be set to the appropriate name when a Camera is constructed. |
| __handle | A private instance variable that contains the camera's handle. Note that this is a read only variable, meaning it should never be changed or set. PVCAM will handle the updating of this attribute when the camera is opened or closed.	|
| __is_open | A private instance variable that is set to True if the camera is currently opened and False otherwise. Note that this is a read only variable, meaning it should never changed or set. PVCAM will handle the updating of this attribute whenever a camera is opened or close.	|
| __acquisition_mode | A private instance variable that is to be used internally for determining camera status. The variable is set to Live upon calling start_live, Sequence upon calling start_seq or None upon calling finish.
| __exposure_bytes| A private instance variable that is to be used internally for setting up and capturing a live image with a continuous circular buffer. Note that this is a read only variable, meaning that it should never be changed or set manually. This should only be modified/ read by the start_live and get_live_frame functions.	|
| __mode| A private instance variable that is to be used internally for setting the correct exposure mode and expose out mode for the camera acquisition setups. Note that his is a read only variable, meaning that it should never be changed or set manually. This should only be modified by the magic __init__ function and _update_mode function. If you want to change the mode, change the corresponding exposure modes with setters bellow.	|
| __exp_time | A private instance variable that is to be used internally as the default exposure time to be used for all exposures. Although this variable is read only, you can access it and change it with setters and getters below. The basic idea behind this abstraction is to use this variable all the time for all exposures, but if you need a single, quick capture at a specific exposure time, you can pass it in the get_frame, get_sequence, and get_live_frame functions as the optional parameter.	|
| __binning | A private instance variable that is to be used internally as the desired binning for acquisitions. Its used for setting up acquisitions with binning and resizing the returned pixel data to 2D numpy array. Although this variable is read only, you can access/ modify it below with the binning, bin_x, and bin_y setters/ getters below.	|
| __roi  | A private instance variable that is to be used internally as the region of interest (roi) for acquisitions. Its used for setting up acquisitions with the specified roi and resizing the returned pixel data to 2D numpy array. Although this variable is read only, you can access/ modify it below with the roi setter and getter.	|
| __shape  | A private instance variable that is to be used internally as the reshape factor for resizing the returned pixel data to 2D numpy array. Note that it is a read only variable, meaning that it should never be changed or set manually. Instead, it is calculated and changed automatically internally whenever the binning or roi of the camera has changed by the _calculate_reshape function.	|
| __bits_per_pixel | A private instance variable that stores the bits per pixel of the currently selected port, speed and gain following a call to start_live or start_seq. |
| __port_speed_gain_table | A private instance variable containing definitions of port, speeds and gains available on the camera. Definitions for each speed include pixel_time. Definitions for each gain include bit_depth. |
| __post_processing_table | A private instance variable containing definitions of post-processing parameters available on the camera. The definitions include a valid range for each parameter. |
| __centroids_modes | A private instance variable containing centroid modes supported by the camera. |
| __clear_modes | A private instance variable containing clear modes supported by the camera. |
| __exp_modes | A private instance variable containing exposure modes supported by the camera. |
| __exp_out_modes | A private instance variable containing exposure out modes supported by the camera. |
| __exp_resolutions | A private instance variable containing exposure resolutions supported by the camera. |
| __prog_scan_modes | A private instance variable containing programmable scan modes supported by the camera. |
| __prog_scan_dirs | A private instance variable containing programmable scan directions supported by the camera. |

##### Internal methods
| Method        | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| _calculate_reshape | This method calculates the new reshape factor for an image whenever a parameter that would change frame dimension (binning, roi) is modified. The reshape factor is used on all methods that return an image to ensure correct image dimensions.

This should really only be called internally (and automatically) when exposure mode or expose out mode is modified.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |

#### Getters/Setters of Camera: 
All getters and setters can be accessed using the example below. There is one large implementation point to make note of: 
<ul><li>All getters/setters are accessed by attribute. This means that it will appear that we are accessing instance variables from a camera, but in reality, these getters/setters are making specially formatted calls to the Camera method get_param/set_param. These getters/setters make use of the property decorator that is built into Python. The reasoning behind the usage of the property decorator is that attributes will change dynamically during a Camera's lifetime and in order to abstract PVCAM as far away from the end user as possible, the property decorator allows for users to intuitively view and change camera settings. The downside to this approach is that when a new parameter is required, an associated getter/setter needs to be written and tested. Another downside to this implementation is that attribute lookup time is not instant; instead, a call must be made to the pvcmodule wrapper which will then call PVCAM, which will then return a result to the wrapper, which will finally return the result to the user. The time it takes is currently considered insignificant, but if this were to become an issue, the code could be refactored such that all attributes also have instance variables which are changed only when set_param or their associated setter is called on them. </li></ul>


##### Using Getters/Setters
```
# Assume cam is an already constructed camera.  
curr_gain = cam.gain  # To call getter, simply access it by attribute from the camera. 
```

### constants.py
constants.py is a large data file that contains various camera settings and internal PVCAM structures used to map meaningful variable names to predefined integer values that camera firmware interprets as settings. 
This file is not (and should never be) constructed by hand. Instead, use the most recent version of pvcam.h and run constants_generator.py to build/rebuild this file. A more detailed explanation can be found under the constants_generator.py section, but the basic concept is that pvcam.h is parsed line by line, finding all predefined constants, enums, and structs to grant Python users access to the necessary data to perform basic PVCAM functions that have multiple settings. 
There are four main sections to this file that are found following a formatted comment like this ### <SECTION_NAME> ###: 
1. Defines
   1. Much of the necessary data from pvcam.h is saved as C preprocessor macros which are easy to strip from the file and construct a Python variable who's name is the macros name and the value is what the macro expands to. 
   2.  Macros can be thought of as Python variables in this case, as none (of the necessary macros) in pvcam.h expand to more than a literal. 
2. Enums
   1. Enums (also known as enumerated types) are data types that contain named members used to identify certain integer values. Typically, if no values are specified, the first member will be assigned the value 0, and the successor will be 1+ the value of their predecessor. However, you can specify specific numbers for all members. 
   2. Vanilla Python has no enum type (it must be imported; see documentation here), and even still Python's enum class behaves somewhat differently in terms of accessing members. Instead, we will insert a comment above all enumerated types and have their members just be simple Python variables who's values where the integer assigned to them in the pvcam.h file.
3. Structs
   1. While not used (yet), structs are preserved as Python classes. No testing/implementation has been done with these, so results may be unexpected if implemented.
4. Added By Hand
   1. These are quality of life/readability dictionaries that map named settings of various camera modes to their pvcam.h integer value. These allow for fast look-up and intuitive setting changes for end users. 

### pvcmodule.cpp
pvcmodule.cpp is a set of C++ functions that make use of and extend the Python C-API known as a Python Extension Module. The need for a Python extension module is two-fold: first to allow communication between the static PVCAM library and Python scripts, and second for fast acquisition and conversion from native C types (namely C arrays of pixel data) to Python data types. 
The extension module needs to be compiled, so it will be necessary to have a C/C++ compiler to successfully install this application. The module will be compiled into a shared-object library, which can then be imported from Python; read more here. 

#### General Structure of a pvcmodule Function 
The functions for a pvcmodule function usually follow a three step process: 
1. Retrieve data/query from Python script 
2. Process acquired data 
3. Return data to Python scrip

#### Retrieving Data
Functions receive data dynamically through use of parameters, and the pvcmodule's functions are no different. However, the Python API states that all data is of type PyObject, which the C/C++ programming language offer no builtin support for. In addition to, each Python-facing function must only have two arguments: PyObject *self (a pointer to the instance of whichever Python object called this C function) and PyObject *args (a Python tuple object that contains all of the arguments passed into the C function call). However, we can make use of the PyArg_ParseTuple (see example here) function from the Python API to easily coerce the Python objects from the args tuple to their respective C type. In order for the conversion to occur, we must specify which type we want to coerce each Python argument to using a formatted string (see second argument for PyArg_ParseTuple). Each character in the formatted string are known as "format units" and are interpreted in the same order that the variables for the coerced C data are provided. Find below a small list of C data types and their corresponding format units. 

| C Type         | Character Representation |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| long           | l                        |
| int            | i                        |
| double         | d                        |
| float          | f                        |
| string (char*) | s                        |
| PyObject       | O                        |

#### Arguments of PyArg_ParseTuple 
1. args (PyObject *) A Python tuple object that contains the arguments from the Python function call. For example, if a function call from Python is made: my_c_func(1, "test"), the args tuple would contain two PyObject pointers: one to the Python integer 1 and another to the Python Unicode-String "test". 
2. format (char *) A String containing the format units for all of the arguments found in the args in the same order in which they appear in the tuple. Going off of the example from the previous argument, the desired formatted string would be "is": 'i' for the integer 1, and 's' for the string "test". 

In addition to these two arguments, addresses to the variables in which the coerced C data should be stored must also be passed as arguments to the PyArg_ParseTuple call. (See example for more details).

#### PyArg_ParseTuple Example
```
static PyObject *example(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {     
	int myNum;     
    char *myString; 
    PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "is", &myNum, &myString);     
    printf("myNum: %d\n", myNum);        // Prints "myNum: 1"     
    printf("myString: %s\n", myString);  // Prints "myString: test"     
    Py_RETURN_NONE; 
    } 
```

#### Processing Acquired Data 
Using the data supplied by the Python function call, we can now perform normal camera operations using PVCAM library function calls. The most common form of processing acquired data is to read the camera handle from the arguments provided, then performing a camera operation (changing/reading settings, getting images, etc.) using the acquired handle to identify which camera to perform the action on. 

Generally speaking, this part of the function should be very similar to writing normal C/C++ modules that use the PVCAM library. If there is any confusion about how to write C/C++ code to make calls to PVCAM, refer to the PvcamCodeSamples found in the Examples directory of the PVCAM SDK. 

Sometimes, processing data from a Python function call may entail answering a query. If this is the case, we need to specify what to return, and how to convert it into a corresponding Python type.

#### Return Data to a Python Script 
Similar to how issues arose when passing data from the Python function call to the C/C++ module, there is no simple casting solution to convert C/C++ data types to Python data types when returning from a function. 

Thankfully, there are some functions that were included in the Python header file included at the top of each module to allow us to cast data to an equivalent Python type. 

#### Cast to Python Type 
```
{     
char *myString = "ika";     
return PyUnicode_FromString(myString); // Returns a Python string back to the calling function. 
}
```

There is one small catch, however. All Python functions must return an object; there is no such thing as a "void" function. This means that we must always return something in our C/C++ modules as well (which we can tell by looking at the signature!) 
If you wish to return None, simply use the Py_RETURN_NONE macro (see the PyArg_ParseTuple example for a visual representation).

#### Functions of pvcmodule.cpp

#### The Method Table
All functions that need to be exposed to Python programs need to be included in the method table. The method table is partially responsible for allowing Python programs to call functions from an extension module. It does this by creating a list of PyMethodDef structs with a sentinel struct at the end of the list. The list of method definitions are then passed to the PyModuleDef struct, which contains the necessary information to construct the module. 

The method table is a list of PyMethodDef structs, which have the following four fields:

| Field Name | C Type      | Description                                                             |
| -----------| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ml_name    | char *      | Name of the method (when called from Python)                            |
| ml_meth    | PyCFunction | Pointer to the C implementation of the function in the module.          |
| ml_flags   | int         | Flag bits indicating how the call to the function should be constructed |
| ml_doc     | char *      | Points to the contents of the docstring for the method.                 |

All docstrings for the functions inside of pvcmodule.cpp are statically defined in the pvcmodule.h file. 

#### The Module Definition
The PyModuleDef structure contains all of the information required to create the top-level module object.

| Field Name | C Type           | Description                                                              |
| -----------| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| m_base     | PyModuleDef_Base | Always initialize this member to PyModuleDef_HEAD_INIT                   |
| m_name     | char *           |Name for the new module (must match the name in the Module Init function).|
| m_doc      | char *           | Docstring for the module (statically defined in the header file)         |
| m_size     | Py_ssize_t       | Specifies the additional amount of memory a module requires for it's "state".<br><br> Only needed if running in sub-interpreters; otherwise set to -1, signifying that the module does not support subinterpreters because it has global state.                                              |
| m_methods  | PyMethodDef*     | pointer to the method table. Can be NULL if no functions are present.    |

After creating the module definition structure, it can then be passed into the module creation function.
#### Module Creation 
The module initialization function will create and return the module object directly. 

To initialize a module, write the PyInit_{modulename} function, which calls and returns the value of PyModule_Create. See example below: 

#### Creating Extension Module 
```
PyMODINIT_FUNC 
PyInit_pvc(void) 
}
return PyModule_Create(&pvcmodule); 
} 
```

### constants_generator.py 
The purpose of the constants_generator.py file is to easily construct a new constants.py data file should the file become tainted or a new version of PVCAM is released. 

The script targets three main parts of the header file: the predefined macros, the enums, and the structs.

#### Requirements 
The constants generator targets the install location of the PVCAM SDK on your machine, meaning that the script will fail to run if you do not have the SDK installed. 

#### Running the Script 
In order to run the script, ensure that you are running it from /PyVCAM/pyvcam/src/, or else it will fail to find the correct directory to write the generated constants.py file to. 

The script can be run using the following command when you are in the correct directory: python constants_generator.py
***
## tests
The tests directory contains unit tests to ensure the quality of the code of the module and to also include some basic examples on how to perform basic operations on a camera.

### change_settings_test.py (needs camera_settings.py) 
change_settings_test.py is used to show one way of keeping camera settings in one file and importing them to update a camera's settings in another file. 

This allows the user to quickly change the settings they wish to test on a camera without having to dig through a large testing script and manually changing the settings within it.

**Note:** camera_settings.py needs to be included in the same directory in order to run this test.

### check_frame_status.py
check_frame_status.py is used to demonstrate how to querry frame status for both live and sequence acquisition modes. 

### live_mode.py 
live_mode.py is used to demonstrate how to peroform live frame acquistion using the advanced frame acquistion features of PyVCAM. 

### meta_data.py 
meta_data.py is used to demonstrate how to enable frame meta data. Meta data is only supported when using the advanced frame acquistion features of PyVCAM. 

### multi_camera.py 
multi_camera.py is used to demonstrate how control acquire from multiple cameras simultaneously. 

### seq_mode.py 
seq_mode.py is used to demonstrate how to perform sequence frame acquistion using the advanced frame acquistion features of PyVCAM. 

### single_image_polling.py 
single_image_polling.py is used to demonstrate how to collect single frames from a camera, starting from the detection and opening of an available camera to calling the get_frame function. 

Note that this test does not display the frame; only saves it locally to a variable and prints a few pixel points from it. If you want an example of how to quickly display a frame, see single_image_polling_show.py.

### single_image_polling_show.py
single_image_polling_show.py is used to demonstrate how to collect a single frame from a camera and use matplotlib's pyplot subpackage in order to display the captured frame. 

**Note:** The test reverses the camera's sensor size when reshaping the array. This is because the camera sensor size tuple is row x column, and the shape of a numpy array is specified by column x row. 

### sw_trigger.py 
sw_trigger.py is used to demonstrate how to perform a software trigger using two Python threads, one to configure acquisition and one to perform the trigger. 

### test_camera.py
test_camera.py contains the unit tests for this module. It tests the getting, setting, and edge cases of all available settings. 

All unit tests can be run from the command line using the command python -m unittest discover 
***
## setup.py
setup.py is the installer script for this module. Once the package has been downloaded, navigate the the src directory to run the setup script.

### Variables

| package_dir | Dictionary that maps the name of the package from the packages list to the directory that contains their source code. Again, this will only have a single member since we only have one package. |
| pvc_modules | List containing the names of the modules contained within the package. In our case, we only have two Python modules: constants.py and camera.py |
| include_dirs | List of directories that contain necessary files to include for the python extension module. For example; the pvcam.h file needs to be included, and so does the numpy.h file. |
